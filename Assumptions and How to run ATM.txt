Following Assumptions were made to design this application:

1. assuming JDK-7 is installed on the user machine to run this application
2. User is already having account with the bank (7 digits bank# is hypothetically chosen:1000011)

3. RunATM class is created to run the code,
	first it will create an account for 'Mr. Brown with Rs. 50000 and also set up his pin as '9876'.

	so please enter this PIN when you try to run this RunATM class.


4. I have made a little change from the description mentioned in the question -
	I am running the same session for Mr. Brown i.e. his balance will be updated with the deposits and withdrawal requests until
	a letter other than ('D','d','w','W') is pressed.
